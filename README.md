```text
data/raw/          Immutable source CSVs (proprietary; kept local, not in Git)

notebooks/         Exploratory and presentation notebooks
src/ql2_sixt_canada_analysis/   Reusable Python source package
tests/             Automated validation (pytest)

```

- `data/raw/` is immutable input data: never edit, rename, or overwrite it.
- Generated data belongs in `data/interim/` or `data/processed/`.
- Reusable logic belongs under `src/ql2_sixt_canada_analysis/`.
- Automated validation belongs under `tests/`.
- Notebooks should import and call functions from the source package rather
  than contain duplicated production logic.

Setup and tests (Python 3.11+):

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

## Data trust

- All scheduled cities represented
- All expected locations present in jobs
- Job level counts = detail row counts
- Valid offers duplicated
- Job timestamps consistent
- Date field that defines reporting day
- Location/Product attributes stability

## Airport matched premium

Charge difference between airport and downtown

- City
- Vehicle type
- Capture time
- Price percentile
- Percentage of matches where the airport is higher

## Genuine pricing events

- Matched offer frequency from one hour to the next
- Typical increase/decrease
- Simultaneuous products move count
- Do airport/downtown locations move together
- New price persistence
- Simultaneous assortment change
- Duplicated large moves across aliased locations

## Visible assortment stability

- Offers per location and capture
- Which products appear/disappear
- Isolated/widespread changes
- Consecutive product sets similarity
- Falling assortment vs. price increases

## QL2 controls

- Expected/location completeness
- Job/detail reconciliation
- Duplicate/location/alias detection
- Timestamp offset validation
- Product attribute consistency
- Large synchronized price change alerts
- Assortment drop alerts
- Persistence confirmation
